This is a brand new book with fresh, original, groundbreaking ideas. The book represents a significant and unique treatment of the most famous Shakespeare’s tragedy. It is essential for the students of Shakespeare, English literature, philosophy, aesthetics, theatre, performing arts…<br />
<br />
On the basis of the study of Hamlet by Lev S. Vygotsky, the book Philosophy in ‘Hamlet’ points out the philosophical problems set in Shakespeare’s enigmatic tragedy: the problem of being, the problem of the nature of reality, or another reality and another world, the problem of the transcendent, as well as the problem of time which is associated with a four-dimensional perception of reality, feelings of absurdity and meaning, then the problem of the supernatural, idem est the metaphysical, and the philosophy expressed in the tragedy of Hamlet.<br />

2.) Can the library access a particular movie for my class?<br />
David Rachlin: Hello Patricia.<br />
I'd be happy to help you.'<br />
We do have access to quite a few films.<br />
Which one in particular are you thinking of?<br />
Patricia Bethea Whitfield: I have two needs:<br />
1.) to see a list of available movies to see if there is one that fits my needs and<br />
2.)  I need to know if you have or can access Rachel Getting Married for the Advanced Marriage and Family Counseling Class<br />
David Rachlin: Ok.  Let me see what I can find for you.<br />
I don't believe that I can generate a list of all our film holdings. There would be far too many to just read through.<br />
I will look to see if we have access to Rachel Getting Married.<br />
If you could tell me a bit more about what your needs for a film are, I'd be happy to help you locate an appropriate one.<br />
Patricia Bethea Whitfield: How can I see what is available.  I tried advanced search but it was a st of materials about movies.  I need movies with the idea that I have the class all watch the same one or two through the library if possible<br />
I am looking for movies with some complexity of character like Antwone Fisher but not necessarily thhat movie that students can use to do a case conceptualization.  This is a mental health counseling advanced class.<br />
David Rachlin: I see.<br />
I see a few options that may be helpful.<br />
One is to search in the catalog and narrow by DVD video.<br />
Let me see if I can come up with a search that works and send you a link.<br />
Patricia Bethea Whitfield: Thank you<br />
David Rachlin: https://ncat.on.worldcat.org/search?sortKey=LIBRARY&amp;databaseList=&amp;queryString=%28x0%3Avideo+%2B+x4%3Advd%29&amp;changedFacet=scope&amp;overrideStickyFacetDefault=&amp;selectSortKey=LIBRARY&amp;overrideGroupVariant=&amp;overrideGroupVariantValue=&amp;scope=sz%3A31512&amp;format=all&amp;year=all&amp;yearFrom=&amp;yearTo=&amp;author=all&amp;topic=all&amp;database=all&amp;language=all<br />
That will show you a listing of all our DVD movies.<br />
There are over 1,100 of them though, so I'm not sure that's the best option.<br />
Patricia Bethea Whitfield: THat's ok.  This is a good start.  I am hopeful that I can fnd several that will work and be able to tell students how to access them at no cost through the library.  Thanks.<br />
David Rachlin: Another option would be to use Kanopy.<br />
Kanopy is a film streaming service that would allow students to watch movies from their homes.<br />
It's available from the Public Library..<br />
We don't have a subscription to that because it's not really an academic resource.<br />
www.kanopy.com<br />
Anybody can register using their public library card.<br />
Greensboro public has a subscription, and I'm sure other public libraries in NC do as well.<br />
Patricia Bethea Whitfield: I did not know about Kanopy.  I hope we will get it too because movies can be good teaching tools because they are well developed ""life stories"" with ""plots"" with which students can practice case conceptualization.  I hope we will get it too:)  David these are great suggestions.  I will check out our offerings first.  Thanks<br />
David Rachlin: You're welcome.  If you have additional questions, I would recommend you email the head of our Access Services department, Octavious Spruill odspruill@ncat.edu.<br />
Patricia Bethea Whitfield: Can you order a movie if we do not have it?<br />
David Rachlin: We may be able to order a movie through Interlibrary Loan, or you could request the purchase of a film.  Octavious would be the best person to ask about that.<br />
Patricia Bethea Whitfield: ok.  Thanks again.  Have a great day.  this was a great experience.<br />
David Rachlin: Thank you too!  Have a great day!","","David Rachlin","LibChat","","Borrow DVD","","","",""

Hi Anna, One question. Do you know what building replaced it?<br />
Anna White: Aggie Village replaced Scott Hall according to Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_A%26T_State_University<br />
""The Aggie Village, commonly referred to as simply ""The Village,"" are the<br />
 newest residence halls built on campus. Completed in 2005, the <br />
centrally located six building complex contains four three-story <br />
residential buildings, two administrative buildings with offices and <br />
classroom space.[77]<br />
 The four residential units within the complex are named for Ezell <br />
Blair, Franklin McCain, Joseph McNeil, and David Richmond; collectively <br />
known as the A&amp;T Four and replaced the former W. Kerr Scott Hall which was ceremoniously demolished on July 11, 2004""<br />

Then I typed my research topic in the search bar but im getting very few journal articles am i supposed to find journals somewhere else?<br />

im not sure if you can view the link but it says Bluford Library<br />
David Rachlin: I see.  That is Aggie Gold Search which is a link to our catalog.<br />
It's not going to provide you with much information about journal articles at the article level.<br />
You're going to want to search a more specific database than that, like ProQuest Central.<br />
Courtney: My research is on any project management topic so i chose trends in project management could it be my topic<br />
how do i get to ProQuest Central?<br />
David Rachlin: You're also going to want to come up with a much more specific topic than that.  Trends in project management is going to be very general.  I'd recommend that you approach the selection of a paper topic by asking yourself what question you want to find an answer to.<br />
Proquest, and all the other databases we have access to are in the alphabetical listing right below the search window you used.<br />
There's a lot we can do via chat, but I would also recommend that you come into the library and get assistance from a librarian.  We can spend some time with you in person to help you with best practices and search strategies to find the articles you need and make your research more effective.<br />
Courtney: Okay i think that would be best for me to come into the library i am a distant learner but i dont live far is there anyway i can come this afternoon<br />
will you be there after 5?<br />
David Rachlin: Yes.  Just come to the research desk on the right side of the entry level.  There will be someone there until 8pm.<br />

I started off with Trends in project management and that was too broad so im thinking about how does project management intertwine with construction management or is that too broad? i was told to come visit the library so that I could get help and i did but the lady that was helping me couldnt really assist me because she didnt know much about project management she did show me how to find the journals but when i got home a began researching im still having a problem finding articles thats why i want to see if my topic is too broad<br />
David Rachlin: Hi Courtney, we spoke earlier.  I think you've got a good idea about the intersection of project management and construction management.<br />
A would use those as search terms in one of the scholarly databases.<br />
You will also likely want to use ""logistics""as a search term.<br />
Let me try running a search for you and see if I can direct your attentions to the right place.<br />

okay i will try that thank you<br />

graduate degree<br />
David Rachlin: There's going to be a lot of research about food deserts.  What question are you looking for an answer to?<br />
Ali: I was told by my professor to find papers that studies food reset areas from soil and water point of view. they are usually focused on marketing but we want to study them from soil and water point<br />
David Rachlin: Food desert is a term that usually refers to the availability of quality groceries in an inner city urban area or extremely remote rural area.  It doesn't actually have anything to do with soil and water.<br />
Ali: exactly. we want to see what are the issues with the soil or water in that areas that prevent this lack of availability. they say sometimes the soil or water is in a way that it is not economical for farmers to harvest in these areas. As an example, the cost of harvesting something in those areas are higher than the price that they have to sell their products.<br />
David Rachlin: I see.  I'm afraid that this isn't going to be a topic you'll be able to research.  Food Desert refers to the availability of food at a retail level.  It has nothing to do with the ability or lack thereof to grow crops.<br />
East Greensboro is a Food Desert.<br />
It's no more expensive to sell quality foods there than it is anywhere else in Greensboro.<br />
Food Desertification is a socioeconomic issue, not an agricultural one.<br />
Ali: sure. So, I will talk to the professor and ask for more clarifications and/or ask him for a solution. thank you so much for your help<br />

Patricia Bethea Whitfield: Hi Evelyn...hope you are well.<br />
Evelyn Blount: Hi Dr. Whitfield, please give me a few minutes to check our online catalog.<br />
Patricia Bethea Whitfield: Evelyn, I have to step away.  Please let me know what you find out.  There used to be copies in the library but I did not see it in my search.  Counseling students use this book for review so I want to be able to tell them they can access it in the library without having to buy it.  I will check back for your response later.  Thanks.<br />

help than ever with an expanded section on marriage and family <br />
counseling, new material on web counseling, and updated material <br />
throughout. This resource now includes 1,050 turorial questions and a <br />
new ""Final Review and Last Minute Super Review Boot Camp"" section. This <br />
guide is an ideal review tool for state licensing, the NCC credential, <br />

You can find copies of NC A&amp;T dissertations here: https://digital.library.ncat.edu/dissertations/<br />

Aaron West: Yes.<br />
Is there a way to access more recent dissertations? Anything after 2015 is not in there.<br />
Anna White: Unfortunately, that is our only collection of dissertations by A&amp;T students.  Are you looking for something in particular?  I may be able to locate it for you elsewhere.<br />
Aaron West: Yes, maybe you can. Hand on<br />
I am  looking for ""Ida B. Wells-Barnett: A Transformative Leader"" by Dr. Pernella K. Koonce. This is her dissertation from here in 2019<br />

Suz: I'm looking for a scholarly article on fashion. How do I go about searching for something valid I suppose<br /><br />
Harvey Long: I would begin with an AggieGold Search. What about fashion? History, market, etc.? <br /><br />
Suz: Yeah history would work.<br /><br />
Harvey Long: Check out the results from this AggieGold Search: https://ncat.on.worldcat.org/search?sortKey=LIBRARY&amp;databaseList=1708%2C2570%2C638&amp;queryString=fashion+AND+History&amp;changedFacet=year&amp;overrideStickyFacetDefault=&amp;selectSortKey=LIBRARY&amp;overrideGroupVariant=&amp;overrideGroupVariantValue=&amp;scope=&amp;subformat=Artchap%3A%3Aartchap_artcl&amp;content=fullText&amp;year=2012..2021&amp;yearFrom=&amp;yearTo=&amp;author=all&amp;database=all&amp;language=all<br /><br />
You can always start on the library homepage, library.ncat.edu, and enter ""fashion"" and ""history"" into the search box. <br /><br />
Suz: Thank you! I hope this isn't a bad question but how can I tell when something is considered ""scholarly""?<br /><br />
Harvey Long: That's a great question! <br /><br />
You can tell if an article is scholarly, or peer-reviewed by the entry. You will usually see the words ""peer-reviewed."" You will also see references or a bibliography.<br /><br />
Look for the author as well.<br /><br />
Is the author from a university? The length is also an indicator. Scholarly articles are usually longer than 5 pages. <br /><br />
Suz: Okay great. I really appreciate the information. I actually thought I had to look on a .org or .edu website<br /><br />
Thank you so much for your help!<br /><br />
Harvey Long: Organizations and educational institutions can provide credible information. However, our databases include peer-reviewed articles, otherwise locked behind a paywall.  <br /><br />

David Rachlin: I can't see what you're looking at.  Can you paste a link here so I can see the paragraphs you're talking about?<br />
aubree: Franklin Eugene McCain was born in Union County, North Carolina but grew up in Washington, DC. After graduating from Eastern High School, he entered A&amp;T College and earned a Bachelor of Science in chemistry and biology in 1964. He later earned his Master of Arts from A&amp;T and also studied and trained at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, Princeton University in New Jersey, Farr Associates in Greensboro and American Management Association in New York City. McCain recalls that as they talked from September 1959 until January 31, 1960, “we had a common outlook to change the unjust conditions in the society that was pushed forward by frustration.”<br />
<br />
Dr. McCain has held leadership positions in numerous community organizations including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. and the National Conference of Christians and Jews. He has sat on the Board of Visitors at Bennett College for Women and the Board of Trustees at North Carolina Central University (July 1, 2005-June 30, 2009) among many others. Dr. McCain was chair of A&amp;T's Board of Trustees from 2008-2009 and is now a member of the UNC Board of Governors (2009-2013). He holds membership in the A&amp;T Alumni Association.<br />
<br />
Dr. McCain was awarded the honorary Doctor of Philosophy in humanities from NC A&amp;T State University on May 5, 1991.<br />
David Rachlin: I'm not sure how that could be cut down much more except for maybe to remove most of the information about his studies.  Only include the fact that he earned a BS in Chemistry and an MA from A&amp;T.<br />

ok<br />
David Rachlin: Hello Sade.  I'd be happy to assist you with that.<br />
Sade Robinaon: Ok thank you<br />
David Rachlin: The best way to search journals is to come up with some search terms for your chosen topic and then put those into a database that has full text articles in it.<br />
What are you researching.<br />
?<br />
Sade Robinaon: adolescent health, child ad family studies, marriage and family<br />
David Rachlin: Ok... so, the first thing I would recommend is to choose one of those areas.  Adolescent health is probably a good place to start.<br />
Are you writing a research paper?<br />
Sade Robinaon: Yes. It is like a peer review paper.<br />
David Rachlin: Great. Do you have an assigned topic, or do you have to pick on?<br />
one?<br />
Sade Robinaon: I have to pick one<br />
David Rachlin: That's great!  I always advise students to start with choosing a question they'd like to find an answer to.  It's a lot easier to find an answer than it is to try to prove a point.<br />
Do you have a central research question that you'd like to try to answer?<br />
Sade Robinaon: Not exactly. We just have to pick a journal article, summarize it and connect it to things we have learned in the class. I would like to focus on child development in infant years.<br />
David Rachlin: That's a great place to start.<br />
What would you like to learn about infant development?<br />
Sade Robinaon: Social development<br />
David Rachlin: Wonderful!  You'll find lots of articles about that.<br />
Sade Robinaon: Ok<br />
David Rachlin: I would first recommend you go here http://www.library.ncat.edu/db/P21.<br />
Sade Robinaon: Ok<br />
David Rachlin: That is ProQuest Central, which is a huge database of all kinds of articles.<br />
When you get there, check off the ""full text"" and ""peer reviewed"" checkboxes under the search bar.<br />
Sade Robinaon: Ok<br />
Then do I just type infant social development<br />
David Rachlin: I would start with a search like - infant AND ""social development""<br />
that way you<br />
you'll get ""social development"" as a phrase, and not just the individual words.<br />
You're going to need to narrow that search down some though, because you'll find about 12,000 journal articles.<br />
Sade Robinaon: Ok<br />
David Rachlin: So I'd start by looking through those search results to see if there are any common key words that the authors talk about.<br />
Sade Robinaon: Ok<br />
David Rachlin: You might want to add ""poverty"" or ""economic status"" or ""early childhood education"" to the search.<br />
Social development of infants has a lot of factors that contribute to success levels, and adding one of those factors will give you a much more specific type of article.<br />
Sade Robinaon: ok<br />
David Rachlin: Don't close this window, but try those techniques, and let me know if you find something you think you can use.  I'll be here.<br />
Sade Robinaon: Ok<br />
I found one that says Promoting Social Development: Helping Infants Learn About Feelings<br />
David Rachlin: That sounds like it's a good one to start with!<br />
You can apply these same search techniques to just about any area of study.<br />
Sade Robinaon: Ok thank you<br />

E.F. Moore: You are looking at a page with differing views on prostitution for different sources. Scroll down, one of the infographics is about views regarding legalization of prostitution. Looks like prostitution is also a part of human trafficking<br />
Jade: so i only need the one link ?<br />
E.F. Moore: Under ""featured viewpoints"" there is a 98-- click on that and it will show you another 98 sources.  Hopefully you can find something.  Your paper could start like -- This paper will examine the issue of prostitution and explore whether legality of this profession is warranted.  (Then you choose 2 or 3 issues)  Specifically, we will look at (1, 2, 3).   Next paragraph should start with 1.  You can also give your opinion.  I hope this helps.<br />
Did your professor say you had to use more than one database?<br />
Or you can go to the top (search box) and put in prostitution and legal*<br />
Anything else?<br />

<p>I apologize for the delay, it took me a minute to locate resources for all the scales you mentioned, but this is what I was able to find:</p>

<ul><li>POB and CWB are both mentioned in this dissertation on pages 58 and 60: https://search.proquest.com/docview/304975196?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true</li>
	<li>The library's catalog has numerous articles on the Occupational Self Efficacy Belief Scale here: https://ncat.on.worldcat.org/search?sortKey=LIBRARY&amp;databaseList=1708%2C2570%2C638&amp;queryString=Occupational+Self-Efficacy+Belief+Scale&amp;changedFacet=format&amp;overrideStickyFacetDefault=&amp;selectSortKey=LIBRARY&amp;overrideGroupVariant=&amp;overrideGroupVariantValue=&amp;scope=sz%3A31512&amp;format=Artchap&amp;subformat=Artchap%3A%3Aartchap_artcl&amp;subformat=Artchap%3A%3Aartchap_digital&amp;subformat=Artchap%3A%3Aartchap_chptr&amp;year=all&amp;yearFrom=&amp;yearTo=&amp;author=all&amp;database=all&amp;language=all</li>
	<li>Here is a downloadable dissertation that mentions the Occupational Outcome Expectations Scale: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjU-5mkgfrvAhUSc98KHd87AfwQFjABegQIAxAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fetd.ohiolink.edu%2Fapexprod%2Frws_etd%2Fsend_file%2Fsend%3Faccession%3Dcsu1392656839%26disposition%3Dattachment&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hr5r0JadHEiyfe_S6JBxN</li>
	<li>Finally, I found an article on scales measuring Social Cognitive Career Theory: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879108000109</li>
</ul><p> </p>

<p>To find these, I first searched the library's catalog using Aggie Gold Search, which is accessible here: at library.ncat.edu</p>

<p>If I was not able to find results there, I used Google Scholar to locate relevant materials.</p>

<p>You may be required to log into some databases if you are off campus.  Your username will be the first part of your aggie email before the @ symbol and your password will be the one you use for Blackboard/WiFi.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!  Please let me know if you have any questions!</p>

This is not a problem, but I would like to know how it works.<br />
Evelyn Blount: Ebooks are only available for a short period of checkout time. The library pays according to our FTE  and we have to make sure that we are following the guidelines that are stated in the purchase of our online databases.I do not know all of the specifics of the guidelines. Hopefully, by accessing the ebook you will be able to assist your students as needed.<br />
