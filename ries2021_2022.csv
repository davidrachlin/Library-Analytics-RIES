I got a reference style question from our Facebook page and I'm not familiar with Bluford Library's policies on this. Here's the question: Is it possible for my local library, in Walkertown request a book to be transferred from Bluford to Walkertown for a week?
Take your time, Dave!
David Rachlin: Hi Katie,  That patron would need to file an interlibrary loan request with the library in their home town.

David Rachlin: Hello.  I'd be happy to help you.
What is your email address?
Amanuel Tereda: aatereda@aggies.ncat.edu
David Rachlin: If you are off campus, you will need to go to library.ncat.edu, and choose Science Direct from the list of databases there.
http://www.library.ncat.edu/db/S10
You can not log into any databases directly.  You must use our proxy server.
Amanuel Tereda: I don't get you when you say use our proxy server. How do I can use the proxy server without logging in?
David Rachlin: When you choose the database from the library, or use the link I sent you, you will be asked for your aggie OneID.
What happens when you do that?
Amanuel Tereda: It didn't ask me any password. It directly takes me to the science direct website.
David Rachlin: Are you on campus?
Amanuel Tereda: Yes, I am in lab around Macnair hall
David Rachlin: if you are on campus, there is no need for you to log in to science direct.
You have full access to the database just by being connected to campus wi-fi.
Amanuel Tereda: Okay, let me check it.
Amanuel Tereda: I got the warning ""North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University does not subscribe to this content."" I think the problem is related with the subscription of the university to the topic I am looking for, not a problem concerning my access.
David Rachlin: What article were you trying to access?
Can you send me a link?
Amanuel Tereda: Here is the link
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012820276000011X
David Rachlin: There is nothing wrong with the subscription.  We simply do not subscribe to that journal.
I ran a search for another topic, and I was able to access articles.
Amanuel Tereda: So, is there any other means to get the specific journal?
David Rachlin: Let me see if we have a subscription through another database.
Amanuel Tereda: Great! I'll wait
David Rachlin: Ah.... that's not a journal.  It's a book.
Amanuel Tereda: Yes, it is a book. I thought I wrote book not journal. my bad!
David Rachlin: It's available from other UNC system libraries.
https://ncat.on.worldcat.org/v2/search/detail/1235595933?queryString=Unmanned%20Aerial%20Systems%20Theoretical%20Foundation%20and%20Applications&format=Book&subformat=Book%3A%3Abook_digital&subformat=Book%3A%3Abook_printbook&changedFacet=format&clusterResults=true&groupVariantRecords=false
Click on request via interlibrary loan, and we will try to get it for you from another UNC school.
Amanuel Tereda: That's great.
So, how do I get/loan the book? Do I have to wait till my request has approved?
David Rachlin: Yes.  You will need to wait for approval, and then we will notify you whether it's an ebook or a physical copy.
Amanuel Tereda: Great! So, how do I know their decision? Are they gonna send me via email, or .... ?
David Rachlin: Yes.  Our circulation department will follow up with you via e-mail.
Amanuel Tereda: Sounds good!

David Rachlin: Hello, the 3rd floor is a quiet floor.  No collaborative work is allowed.
There are study rooms available to check out for 2 hour blocks, but they are reserved for groups of 3 or more.
Tayanna: So on the third floor you study alone whereas the other 2 you can work together? Also do we have to check in to the library or can we just walk in?
David Rachlin: That is correct.  You can have people sitting together on the 3rd floor, but we ask that you not have study groups or conversations there.  1st and 2nd floors allow group study and collaboration.  You do not need to check in to the library, you can just walk in.  You will need to swipe your ID card at the front door after 10pm which is when we close to anyone who is not part of the A&T community.
Tayanna: Okay, well thank you for the information I greatly appreciate it!

You can access all of our databases, books, and other resources in the library and from our website.

David Rachlin: We have librarians here from 8-5, and there are support staff here during all hours.  You don't need an appointment, and can feel free to come by any time.
The Research Instruction & Engagement Services desk is on the right side when you come in the front door, and someone there can show you around and introduce you to some of our services.
Del L. Ruff: Excellent...I will add a visit to my agenda.
David Rachlin: I would recommend also plugging the article title into Google Scholar and selecting ""related articles"". You may find content there that is useful to you.
If you tell me a little bit more about what you're working on, I can suggest some search strategies in the databases we have access to.
The journal you want is held by the Library of Congress and a few other universities in the US including the publisher Penn State.
You might also use this link https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=dd1E2NekH0u9M7wLHHlsOHXrEf9BnLJFjKBcVpZ83N5URFI2RUxOTUlCRENRTlZCREVGWDdDNDU5Vy4u to request an interlibrary loan, and see if one of our ILL personnel can acquire a copy of the article from another library.

David Rachlin: Hello Arwa.  There is free printing in the library for students.
The printing is black and white only, and one of our librarians can assist you if you need help using the printers.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Arwa: oh thank you very much, does using the printer needs student ID or any Identification document
David Rachlin: You have to log in at the print station using your OneID login information. Same as for blackboard or email.  If you have your ID card, you can swipe it at the terminal and then log in to link your card to your account.  Then all you'll have to do in the future is swipe your card to log in to the print station.  I'd recommend having your OneID card every time you come to campus.
The library is open until 1am, but only open until 10pm to the public, so thats when the doors lock.
If you come at night you will have to swipe your ID to get into the building.
You can also use your OneID at vending machines, and to pay for food on campus, so it's a good idea to have it with you at all times.
I actually keep mine in my wallet in front of my driver's license since I use it more than any other card.
Arwa: thank you very much for helping me
David Rachlin: You are very welcome.
Please feel free to use any of our online services to reach out to us any time, and ask a librarian for help in the library any time you need it!

If you feel uncomfortable due to people not complying with the masking policy, please report your concerns to a security officer the next time you witness this behavior.

As librarians, we are not permitted to tell people they have to wear their masks.  University administration has put a disciplinary policy in place that starts with campus security officers.  Officers will suggest to the student that they wear their masks.  If the students refuse to comply, university police can be involved, but the librarians are not permitted to confront students.

I would also recommend you start searching in Science Direct.
http://www.library.ncat.edu/db/S10

Cody: Low pressure is the perfect term.
David Rachlin: This one is for the 80 scientific encyclopedia articles about delignification.  I suspect some of them will describe a process.
https://www-sciencedirect-com.ncat.idm.oclc.org/search?qs=delignification&articleTypes=EN&lastSelectedFacet=articleTypes
This book chapted has a process description for delignification - https://www-sciencedirect-com.ncat.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/B978044459421100003X
Cody: That is under pressure with bleaching. I will look through the first ones and use more low pressure searches.
Thank you!
David Rachlin: I would also recommend checking ACS journals.
American Chemical Society may have further information.
if you are on campus, I'd also look through Google Scholar, as it will show you resources that we have in our catalog and databases.

This article <https://www.salientwomen.com/2020/06/08/biography-of-juana-ines-de-la-cruz-mexican-poet/> talks about why she stopped writing:

 

""Towards the year 1693, Sor Juana Inés stopped writing and decided to dedicate herself more to religious work.

The reason for such a change is not precisely known; Catholic critics appreciate a greater dedication to supernatural issues after the renewal of their religious vows in 1694.

The truth is that she was forced to stop writing. She had no choice but to fulfill what the ecclesiastical authorities considered a nun’s own tasks.

Thanks to Juan Ignacio María de Castorena Ursúa y Goyeneche, Bishop of Yucatan, the work that Juana Inés de la Cruz had was unpublished when she was condemned to destroy her writings is known.

In early 1695 a typhus epidemic broke out, wreaking havoc throughout the capital of New Spain. In the convent of San Jerónimo nine out of ten sick religious died.

Sor Juana Inés fell ill a short time later, because she collaborated taking care of the sick nuns.

At four in the morning of April 17, 1695, Juana Inés de Asbaje Ramírez died. She was 43 years old.""

 

Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further.

 

Thank you,

David Rachlin: Hi Angel.  There are going to be a lot of articles about LGBTQ youth.
What are you hoping to find?
Angel Baptist: This is for my research method class i am writing a proposal for a that have counseling for youth who need support
So i guess it will be a peer review on the need or lack of support
David Rachlin: What is your research question?
I always tell students who are studying research that you need to begin with a question.
The more specific the question, the better.
Angel Baptist: Do youth seek out counseling or Do counseling work for youth who identify other than heterosexual
David Rachlin: Ok.  That's a good start, but I suspect you're going to find out very quickly that counseling does help people who identify as LGBTQ.
You're likely going to want to refine that question with two more.  1.  What types of counseling have the most effect. and 2. What do you want it to have an effect on?
I would recommend starting your search in ProQuest Central.
I would use the terms ""LGBTQ youth"" AND counseling
just like that with the quotes and all caps for AND
https://www-proquest-com.ncat.idm.oclc.org/central/fromDatabasesLayer
I actually get a lot more results using LGBT Youth.  See here - https://www-proquest-com.ncat.idm.oclc.org/central/results/FACB3FCEE8F4462PQ/1?accountid=12711
Take a look at those articles, and see what they talk about.
From there you should be able to figure out what aspect of LGBT kids lives you want counseling to have an impact on.
Angel Baptist: What kind of intervention work such as CBT
David Rachlin: So ultimately your research question might wind up being something like, Does group therapy have more impact than individual counseling on LGBT youth self actualization, or something along those lines.
CBT is a good point to add.  You might want to use that as a search term in place of counseling.
It will probably give you a different set of results, and you can compare what you find there;
Angel Baptist: i can't seem to login in to access the articles
David Rachlin: It should ask for your Aggie One ID.  It's the same you'd use to log in to blackboard.
If it's not working, you may need to get it reset by CTS, who you can contact by email at helpdesk@ncat.edu
Try this link for ProQuest
http://www.library.ncat.edu/db/P21
Angel Baptist: i am in
David Rachlin: Great.
Try using different search terms.  You may need to eliminate the word Youth because it's hard to get permission to study minors.
And don't be afraid to keep refining your paper topic and research question.
You may wind up with a completely different question from where you started, and THAT'S OK.  
Angel Baptist: Thank you are awesome
David Rachlin: The research process rarely goes in a straight line, and you will keep wrapping back around.
By the time you've figured out what you REALLY want to ask... you'll probably have all your articles, evidence, and citations, and you'll probably have a pretty good idea what you're going to say in your paper.

Or sometimes, author(s) uses a sentence using the word 'hypothesized .....' So, you need to select a journal article using either research questions, hypothesis, or both for your assignment. ""

Thanks for that.  I don't think there's a functioning link there for you to look at.  That research guide is badly out of date, and I have removed it from public accessibility.  The author of the guide left A&T about 3 years ago, and I'm doing much of the work she did previously.

LibApps is an internal Library System, and you wouldn't have access to that anyway, so it's a moot point.

If you need a sample NSF Grant Proposal, I'd recommend contacting DORED.  They have grants specialists who can assist you with preparing a funding proposal.

Harvey Long: Here is a list of databases with marketing intelligence data. 
https://libguides.library.ncat.edu/az.php?q=Marketing
Try this one: https://libguides.library.ncat.edu/az.php?q=Marketing
Cicely Crooks: Got it
Harvey Long: I would also recommend viewing various consumer reports. 
https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm
Cicely Crooks: Are these fairly easy to maneuver through?
Harvey Long: Fairly easy and if you have trouble, we're here to help.
Cicely Crooks: How could I use the consumer reports in this case?
What do you suggest?
Harvey Long: I would also consider using specific names/brands.
Virtual reality is broad. Oculus, for example, is a specific gaming/entertainment headset. 
https://www.proquest.com/marketresearch/results/E92E871BE0854756PQ/1?accountid=12711
Also check out our Business Market Research Collection.
Cicely Crooks: Thank you
Harvey Long: You're welcome. Please reach back out if you need additional assistance. 
Cicely Crooks: Well the paper is about analyzing the market for the new Microsoft Mesh product
which is the first of its kind in the mixed reality space, however, analyzing the VR market gives insight to the mixed reality space
this is also mostly for professionals and less gaming
Harvey Long: I see! 
Here is another search I just conducted:
https://www.proquest.com/central/results/EA92F0099ECE4467PQ/1?accountid=12711
Cicely Crooks: nothing comes up when i click that link
This pops up in the search bar PUBID(5040793) AND (naics(541))
Harvey Long: Take a look at several of those articles to see if they include useful data.

How do I open this report to see the actual data?
Harvey Long: Attached a file: https://ncat.libanswers.com/chat_file.php?i=2202&f=288751

It is a completely cloud based solution, so there is no software required beyond the plugins for cite while you write.

Oh. Is there a license file?

If you are off campus, you will need to login with a username (first part of email before @) and password (same as Blackboard/campus WiFi).

 

I hope this helps!

David Rachlin: Hello Samiya.  All of our databases have lots of peer reviewed articles in them.  If you can tell me a little bit more about what you're looking for, I can give you some specific guidance.
Samiya Hocutt: Hi, I'm trying to find articles that can explain why you do not need to lift heavy weights to build muscle
David Rachlin: Great! That's a topic that will have good search terms within it.  I would start with Proquest Central, which is a large interdisciplinary database.
http://www.library.ncat.edu/db/P21
Samiya Hocutt: Okay, great. My professor recommended PubMed for the semester but I have not had much luck.
Thank you so much
David Rachlin: PubMed has lots of articles for research funded by NIH
You probably want to be searching in human performance journals, and there will be plenty of them in ProQuest.
Is there a specific assignment you are working on?
Samiya Hocutt: Perfect.
Yes. I am writing a couple paragraphs debunking the myth of needed to lift heavy to see results when building muscle.
David Rachlin: Was that an assigned topic?
Samiya Hocutt: It is the topic of my choice
David Rachlin: Perfect. 
Look at it from the perspective of a question.
""Is lifting heavy weights necessary to see results when building muscle?""
It should make the search process clearer when you are looking for articles.
Think about using search terms like ""building muscle"" and ""heavy weights""
Use the quotation marks to make the database search for those complete phrases rather than just individual words.
Samiya Hocutt: Oh that makes sense. The quotation marks must have been the issue.
David Rachlin: It's possible.
Samiya Hocutt: Thank you posing the question different
David Rachlin: Using the quote marks should give you results that are more relevant for what you need.","","David Rachlin","LibChat","Find Article","","","","",""

I also took measurements of things and researched the prices and whatnot. To my question, I did not use any scholarly articles, and I have to have at least two for my assignment. I have two questions: First, how do I cite myself and the things I did on my own? Two, could you point me in the direction of a topic that I could research that would relate to my topic. Below is the purpose of my proposal, which is to update the laundry rooms around campus.


'The purpose of my proposal is to bring attention to the laundry rooms around campus to the university and the housing department. The laundry rooms at North Carolina Agricultural State & Technical University need to be updated. By making this change, the housing experience for students living on campus would be more enjoyable.'
David Rachlin: Hi Destini.  Bear with me while I'm working with another student.
Destini Washington: Take your time.
David Rachlin: Ok.  So, lets start in the first place.
To cite yourself, you would create a citation just like any other, but using yourself as the author.
Destini Washington: Okay.
David Rachlin: You might want to get yourself registered for RefWorks citation management which is provided by the university, and that would help you in organizing your resources.
Destini Washington: Okay, I'll do that.
David Rachlin: As for your research topic, I want you to step back for a moment, and look at the proposal in the form of a question.
What question do you want to answer, and what might make that question more compelling?
What about the laundry rooms needs updating?
Are they poorly lit?
Is there some kind of safety issue?
BTW, you can register for refworks using your aggies.ncat.edu email address here https://refworks.proquest.com/signup/email/
Destini Washington: Okay, I'll get registered. There are not enough washers and dryers for the amount of students.
David Rachlin: OK.  So there could be multiple issues related to that.
Destini Washington: It causes a lot of conflicts in my dorm.
David Rachlin: I would suggest you check out one of our databases like ProQuest Central and search for ""laundry rooms"" ""student housing"" ""campus life"" ""safety"":
Those might give you some relevant results that you can use to better articulate what the problem is.
Destini Washington: Okay, thank so much for you help.
David Rachlin: This sounds like a persuasive essay, and so the most important thing you will need to do is to articulate what the problem is, why it's a problem, and then suggest solutions.
Let me run a demo search for you, and I'll show you some of what you might find.
Destini Washington: okay
David Rachlin: https://www-proquest-com.ncat.idm.oclc.org/central/results/171CC59D544E43E1PQ/1?accountid=12711
take a look at result # 13 and see if that might suit your needs.
Then look at suggested further readings
Destini Washington: Could you send the link again? It is not working.
David Rachlin: https://www-proquest-com.ncat.idm.oclc.org/central/results/171CC59D544E43E1PQ/1?accountid=12711
You may be asked to log in with your OneID if you are off campus
This is a link straight to the article - http://ncat.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www-proquest-com.ncat.idm.oclc.org/scholarly-journals/residential-common-spaces-that-really-work-post/docview/1519532778/se-2?accountid=12711
Destini Washington: That worked. Thank you.
David Rachlin: You're welcome.
In the article, look at the related items on the right.  You may find things about student satisfaction with accomodations.
It may not specifically mention laundry facilities, but there may be other satisfaction issues that you could point out that are related.
Destini Washington: Okay.Thank you so much.
David Rachlin: Just as an example, you might find that students have an issue with not enough seating in common areas causing conflict.
Or a lack of kitchen facilities.
Then relate those conflicts back to the issue with laundry facilities you have noticed, and you're golden.
Destini Washington: Alrighty then, thank you. Have a nice day.","","David Rachlin","LibChat","Find Article","","","","",""

I'm sorry you're having difficulty.  The library will not be renewing the EndNote license due to cost increases.
We have changed our citation management package to RefWorks.

there were several workshops on switching over earlier in the semester, but we will not be offering another one of those until Spring.

David Rachlin: Hello. Do I understand correctly, you are looking for a list of the deans of the school of nursing?
Adrienne Rumph: Yes
David Rachlin: Have you spoken to the school of nursing?
Adrienne Rumph: No but I can start there if you feel it is more appropriate
David Rachlin: I would recommend you contact them first.  If they don't have that information, our archivist James Stewart can probably put together a list of those for you, but as we are preparing for homecoming, he may not be able to get back to you as quickly as he usually would.
Let me get you his contact information.
Adrienne Rumph: Thanks so much! I understand... GHOE is in full swing.
David Rachlin: It is!  We are very excited!
James has been very busy curating our A&Tiques Roadshow.
It's been 2 years since he got to do one, and he's really happy do be doing it again.
Adrienne Rumph: My husband is the Aggie in our home. We love NCA&T
David Rachlin: The library is open to the public, and we currently have a wonderful exhibit of A&T history and artifacts on display.
You should come by and look!
This link https://bit.ly/3vY7AQv is for our digitized yearbooks.  If you wanted to look back through those, you could probably find the deans of all the colleges listed in there.  It would take some time to go through all of them, but you'd have their photographs as well.
Adrienne Rumph: I love history and historical exhibits. We may just have to take you up on your invitation. Thanks so much.
David Rachlin: That same site also has all the A&T bulletins (course listings and university information) going back over 100 years.
Our Archivist is named James Stewart, and you can email him here jrstewa1@ncat.edu.
Adrienne Rumph: Wonderful! I appreciate your time, information and efforts. Enjoy GHOE!
David Rachlin: I hope you do too!  Is there anything else I can help with today?
Adrienne Rumph: No. You have been very helpful. Have a great day.
David Rachlin: Thank you for contacting Bluford Library Adrienne!  Have a wonderful weekend!","","David Rachlin","LibChat","Archives/Yearbook","","","","",""

David Rachlin: Is this an online class, or will you be meeting in person?
Linda Latham: Online class
whole program is online
David Rachlin: Ok.  I would recommend setting up an instruction session with one of our librarians.  Harvey Long is our Student Success Librarian.  If you fill out this form https://ncat.libwizard.com/f/InstructionRequest, you can specifically request him to teach your class.
Linda Latham: Awesome- that would be great!
David Rachlin: We can meet during one of your synchronous sessions, and guide your students through the resources available.
If you have a specific assignment in mind, I'd strongly recommend sharing that information with Harvey, and he can help tailor the instruction to cover general concepts and how to apply them to that work.
Linda Latham: We want to get them ready to search topics, cite in APA, write papers, etc.
David Rachlin: We typically cover all that material in an instruction session.  Fill out the request form and our department head will contact you when it's been scheduled.  Then Harvey can get in touch with you closer to the class date to go over specifics.

Anna White: If you need a copy of a textbook carried by the library, please contact the circulation desk at (336) 285-4164.  They can scan up to three chapters and email them to you.  From there, you can print them out in hard copy form.  If we do not carry the textbook, we can request it via Interlibrary Loan.
If you give me the author and title of the book you need, I'd be happy to search our catalog to see if we carry it.
PROF DESHUNDA BROWN: So I will not be able to get the book itself?
Anna White: Are you located near campus?  If not, you should contact the head of Circulation who can grant patrons permissions to have items mailed to them under special circumstances.  If you live nearby, we can try to procure the item for you and you can pick it up from the building during operational hours.
PROF DESHUNDA BROWN: no distance learning
Do you have this book in E-book: Introduction to Criminal Justice: Systems, Diversity, and Change
Anna White: Please give me one moment and I will look that up for you.
PROF DESHUNDA BROWN: okay thanks
I also need to assigned required text books to my courses
Anna White: I looked up that e-books and it is not something we currently carry.  If you would like, I can request it via Interlibrary Loan and have another library send us a copy for you to borrow.
To assign required textbooks to your courses, you will need to contact the University Bookstore.  Here is a link to their customer service page: https://ncat.bncollege.com/shop/ncat/page/customer-service
PROF DESHUNDA BROWN: Thats odd..that book was used last semester....

We'll send it to UNCG and they can deliver it to you.

Caitlin Reavis: It does allow me to click through! Should I use the login link you entered here for the future? Not the ""sign in"" link on the website?
Harvey Long: You should be able to just sign in when prompted. 
Caitlin Reavis: When I try it says my one ID is invalid. That's just my username, cmreavis + A&T password, right?
For example, if I sign in from here:
https://ncat.on.worldcat.org/advancedsearch?databaseList=
Harvey Long: No need to sign in from the database page, only when it ask you to sign in. 
Caitlin Reavis: I should be able to login from here then: http://www.library.ncat.edu/login
Right? It won't let me. I tried to prompt a password change with cmreavis, but it came up with an error.
Maybe I'm not set up in the system correctly!
Or, because I'm off campus?
Harvey Long: Sounds like it. Reach out to the CTS Aggie Help Desk, 336-334-7195.

I want to see, first, if I'm allowed to visit, and second, to confirm that I'm reading this properly
I want to see issues around 1960, and it looks to me per the record that you have that
David Rachlin: Sure.  It looks like we have those.  I would recommend that you contact Duke University libraries and request the specific volumes you're looking for via Interlibrary Loan.
They will find a library that has what you're looking for and send you scans.
James Chappel: In my experience, periodicals don't circulate usually?
I don't have a particular article in mind, I want to see whole volumes
My hope was to drive over there, it's only 45 minutes away
David Rachlin: You can certainly visit the library as we are open to other researchers.  You would also be welcome to use the photocopier/scanner on our lower level to make duplicates of any particular articles you find that you would like to have copies of.
The bound journals themselves do not circulate out of the building.
James Chappel: ok great! Can I just show up? Do I need to apply online or bring anything in particular?
David Rachlin: Not at all.  Just come in!  I'd recommend stopping by the access services desk when you come in.  It's to the left of the main entrance, and a librarian or technician would be happy to show you to what you're looking for and direct you around the building to the resources you want.
James Chappel: that's great. and I could come any time you're open right? evening might work better for me
David Rachlin: You can certainly come in during the evening. I believe the doors will electronically lock at 11pm and access will be restricted to university students and personnel at that point, but any time before 11pm, you can just come right in!

Thank You for contacting the F. D. Bluford Library with your request for the CRRJ. Right now to my knowledge we do not have a collection specific to ant-civil rights or racial violence. We do have several historically black publications from the region like the Carolina Peacemaker, that are not online and may have investigative articles on violence in and near Greensboro, NC. We have some publications that were digitized by the NC Digital Heritage Center like the Future Outlook (Greensboro, NC) and the AC Phoenix (Winston-Salem, NC) In the State of North Carolina, I can recommend the archives of The University of North Carolina at Greensboro which has an extensive Civil Rights collection and digital project, and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina which is the home of the John Hope Franklin Center. 

I may still be wrong about our collections. If I have an update and another archive recommendation I will contact you again. 

Best,

tyronne James: Hello
Thank you for the response. This is Mr. James from the department of psychology.
I need to create a survey to give to the faculty members. The survey needs to assess their perception of their students writing skills. So I was trying to find a survey that might accomplish this or get help with creating a few survey items..
E.F. Moore: Perhaps you should contact the Writing Center???
tyronne James: okay.. I can do that..
do you have a good contact for them over there?

Tenia McDow: Hello and thank you for allowing me to assist you. Please give me a moment to review your question.
David Rachlin: Hello Dr. Germain, this is David Rachlin, I'm a librarian here at FD Bluford.
Dr. Germain: Hello David! How are you?
David Rachlin: I'm well, and I hope you are too. What is the film you are interested in showing your class?
Dr. Germain: May I say that I am VERY appreciative of everything that you do for the University. You are always a wealth of information.
It is Joker
2019 version
David Rachlin: Let me see what we can do about that.
Dr. Germain: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286456/
I would also like to give the Psych club access, but one of the students mentioned that there is a licensing fee based on the # or projected viewers.
David Rachlin: That's usually the case with most movies.
Do you own a copy of the movie?
Really, the consideration here is with copyright, and there are some questions that we can ask to evaluate whether or not licensing fees are necessary.
Is your class face to face?
Dr. Germain: I do own a copy of the movie and the class is face to face
David Rachlin: Under 17 U.S.C. §110(1), you can show the entirety of the film to a face to face class without paying licensing fees.
Dr. Germain: would the same rules apply if I wanted to have an in house discussion with psych club members? (<20?)
David Rachlin: Absolutely.
Dr. Germain: Super! Thank You. That is helpful.
David Rachlin: 17 U.S.C. §110(1) is a section detailing limitations of rights holders, and flims as teaching materials are generally considered an exception.
https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/copyright/video
https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110
Dr. Germain: Great. Thank you! That is super helpful.
While I have you here...do you happen to know where we are in terms of getting a secure server set up for phi?
David Rachlin: I am not up to date on that one.  Remind me what it's for?
Dr. Germain: I believe Stephanie Texiera Poit is leading the charge on this, but it is relevant to new requirements for some of the data that I work with.https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/conditions-of-use
David Rachlin: OK... HSR data and PII.
Dr. Germain: I can send you the files in an attachment and we can discuss at a later date.
There are new requirements: https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/rda/rda-application-traditional
https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/rda/rda-application-vdi
David Rachlin: I'm not sure what's going on with a secure server on campus, but you might want to also reach out to DORED and ITS.  Tom Jackson's department would most likely be the one doing the actual provisioning of that, and DORED / IRB might know more about how far along we are.
Dr. Germain: RDA Administer registration: https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/rda/rda-administrator-registration
Great.I will do that. Thanks again and stay well

Your entry within our ILL Policies directory still lists you as an ILLiad software user and and your institution also lists an ""Odyssey Address"" which is an ILLiad component. If you are no longer use ILLiad, your ILL person should contact OCLC at support@oclc.org to update this information.
If you need more information, you can contact me (John Trares) at traresj@oclc.org.
There's more support contact information here:

David Rachlin: Hello John, this is Dave, I'm a librarian here.
John Trares: Hi Dave
David Rachlin: I'm honestly not sure how our access services department processes ILL requsts.
Aside from filling out the form, I don't know if they're using ILLiad to fulfill the requests.
I would be happy to forward your information to our head of Access Services, Octavious Spruill, who can give you more information and make any necessary changes.
John Trares: OK .. that sounds good, it doesn't seem like you are using ILLiad anymore but the ILLiad server that you used in the past is still around .. https://ncat.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/logon.html and seems like it needs decommissioned.
David Rachlin: OK.  I'll pass all this on to Octavious.  Is the email address you entered the one you prefer if we need to contact you?

Tenia McDow: Hello and thank you for using Bluford Library Ask-a-Librarian service,
I can give you information about the ILL
http://library.ncat.edu/services/ill.html
here is what is needed and all information about it
https://ncat.libwizard.com/f/ILL
and here is where you submit it
Is there anything else I can assist you with?
John Trares: So .. I work at OCLC and with hosted ILLiad servers. Your entry within our ILL Policies directory still lists you as an ILLiad software user and and your institution also lists an ""Odyssey Address"" which is an ILLiad component. If you are no longer use ILLiad, your ILL person should contact OCLC at support@oclc.org to update this information.
If you need more information, you can contact me (John Trares) at traresj@oclc.org.
There's more support contact information here:
https://help.oclc.org/Librarian_Toolbox/Contact_OCLC_Support/Contact_OCLC_Support_in_your_region
David Rachlin: Hello John, this is Dave, I'm a librarian here.
John Trares: Hi Dave
David Rachlin: I'm honestly not sure how our access services department processes ILL requsts.
Aside from filling out the form, I don't know if they're using ILLiad to fulfill the requests.
I would be happy to forward your information to our head of Access Services, Octavious Spruill, who can give you more information and make any necessary changes.
John Trares: OK .. that sounds good, it doesn't seem like you are using ILLiad anymore but the ILLiad server that you used in the past is still around .. https://ncat.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/logon.html and seems like it needs decommissioned.
David Rachlin: OK.  I'll pass all this on to Octavious.  Is the email address you entered the one you prefer if we need to contact you?
John Trares: yep .. traresj@oclc.org works perfectly.
thanks for your help.
David Rachlin: Thank you!

I apologize for the delay.  Most of the resources that are dealing with current events are not going to be scholarly in nature as newspapers are not peer reviewed.

I would recommend you look at a database called  Opposing Viewpoints in Context.  You can find it here http://www.library.ncat.edu/db/O5.

I think it will probably have what you need.

David Rachlin: Hello Mykayla.
I would begin with the FDBluford Library Catalog.
Can you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for?  It will help me understand what search terms will work best.
Mykayla Shearin-Howard: Hello. Do I just type in the search box. I'm looking for items for my research paper about the oppositional gaze.
David Rachlin: Ok... so I would use the phrase ""oppositional gaze"" as one of your search terms.
Mykayla Shearin-Howard: About how black people fought against racism in films, more specifically films that Ava duVernay directed.
David Rachlin: You can just search in the box, but I think you'd probably be better off looking for sociological journals.  You aren't going to find many books that discuss that.
I would start with a generalist database like ProQuest Central.
Search for Ava DuVernay and ""oppositional gaze""
Mykayla Shearin-Howard: What is ProQuest Central? and how do I use that or my research!
David Rachlin: So ProQuest Central is a database that contains millions of scholarly journal articles.
Has your faculty member specifically stated that you need books?
Mykayla Shearin-Howard: No. Everyone in my class has a different director they are focusing on.
David Rachlin: Ok... so I think your best bet is going to be with journal articles.  There's likely to be lots of film criticism that focuses on Ava duVernay's work, as she's quite an influential director.
ProQuest central is a very large interdisciplinary database, so you're likely to find articles on just about any topic.
If you're in a position to come in to the library, we
we'll be here until 7 tonight, and I'd be happy to sit down with you and show you around the databases.

"o39052996","2022-04-13","11:05","Would it be possible for the library to purchase an e-copy of the book for students to access?","A couple of years ago I worked with Cambridge Scholars Publishing (CSP) to put together a book for my BTEC 239 class. I anticipated that the book would cost roughly $30 when finished. Unfortunately/Fortunately...the book turned out to be more marketable than to just my class, so the publisher has raised the price. The ebook is now a ridiculous $120. Here is a link to the book listing on Google Books: https://www.google.com/books/edition/Computer_Mediated_Communication_for_Busi/qxCsDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0
I teach BTEC 239 online every summer, and while I feel good about continuing to use the book as long as textbooks remain free for students, I would like to have a free option for them thinking past that time. The electronic copy is only available through Google Books because CSP only publishes hard copies.

I appreciate your time and attention!

Thanks,
Stephanie
Stephanie Kelly, PhD","Stephanie,
I have great news for you!
The University (through the Library) already has access to the electronic version of your textbook!
Please place this link on your syllabus and in BlackBoard: https://ncat.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1117639616 and recommend to your students to click ""View Ebook"".
The students will be asked to enter their AggieOne credentials to access the book.

Brinta Chowdhury: yes
our library has the subscription of springer, right?

for example it is showing available here
Candace Jacobs: I clicked on the link to access via your institution and A&T is not listed as a school that has a subscription for these articles
Brinta Chowdhury: but I can't download it
oh
But I was told, A&T has the subscription
Candace Jacobs: The top article says that it is available at Guilford College
Did you speak with someone who told you that?
Brinta Chowdhury: Yes in a library seminar
Candace Jacobs: Ok
I clicked on the link to access each article, and it does not say that A&T has access to the the materials, so I would suggest calling Access Services. They can be reached at 336.285.4185.
Brinta, are you still there?

eBook2022

Cham, Switzerland : Palgrave Macmillan, [2022]

SummaryThis handbook unravels the complexities of the global and local entanglements of race, gender and intersectionality within racial capitalism in times of #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter, the Chilean uprising, Anti-Muslim racism, backlash against trans and queer politics, and global struggles against modern colonial femicide and extractivism. Contributors chart intersectional and decolonial perspectives on race and gender research across North America, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, and South Africa, centering theoretical understandings of how these categories are imbricated and how they operate and mean individually and together. This book offers new ways to think about what is absent/present and why, how erasure works in historical and contemporary theoretical accounts of the complexity of lived experiences of race and gender, and how, as new issues arise, intersectionalities (re)emerge in the politics of race and gender. This handbook will be of interest to students and scholars across the social sciences and humanities.

Joan Hill: Let me check something first
Lakisa Leake: Do we have access to the Taylor & Francis Online database?
Joan Hill: Checking now
Joan Hill: It appears that Interlibrary Loan might be the best option. The libraries we borrow from appear to own it...so hopefully it will not take long.
Joan Hill: https://ncat.libwizard.com/f/ILL
Lakisa Leake: Are they going to send a physical copy or give me online access?
Joan Hill: Above is the Interlibrary Loan form
Joan Hill: For articles...they normally send a scanned copy of the article
Joan Hill: So you will be able to print it out 
Lakisa Leake: I jusr need a digital copy lol
Joan Hill: Ok. It should be able to be emailed as well. 
Joan Hill: The schools that own it are UNCG and HPU.
Joan Hill: If you complete the Interlibrary form...process can get started or you have the option of visiting those libraries 
Joan Hill: May I assist you with anything else?
Lakisa Leake: No thank you
Joan Hill: Ok. Have a Wonderful evening.

If you are familiar with how to get to our databases, you can use Nexus Uni (also accessible here http://ncat.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www.nexisuni.com), to see legal cases and documents.

Also, any court filings in the US are public record, and so you can look at the state and federal court websites to find actual cases that you can read the briefs and decisions for.","","David Rachlin","LibAnswers System","Choose Database","","","","","9668599"
